## Abstract

We verify the outcome of the methodology proposed in the article, which attempts to
provide post-hoc causal explanations for black-box classifiers through causal reference.
This is achieved by replicating the code step by step, according to the descriptions in
the paper. All the claims in the paper have been examined, and we provide additional
metric to evaluate the portability, expressive power, algorithmic complexity and the data
fidelity of their framework. We have further extended their analyses to consider all
benchmark datasets used, confirming results.
