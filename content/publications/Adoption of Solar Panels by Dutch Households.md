## Abstract

The aim of this study was to explore determinants of photo-voltaic and other renewable energy technology adoption rates by Dutch households. Beyond corroboration of earlier existing research, with emphasis on Briguglio and Formosa (2017), the main contributions of
this research include the partial adjustment framework, proving to be a flexible and powerful tool for estimating product growth processes, and suggested determinants of the speed of adjustment parameter. While the idea that financial considerations are key
in the adoption decision process was also found in this analysis, access to roof space and low-urban living space are at least equally as important. Furthermore, while growth seems fast nationwide, there do exist significant differences between education levels, along with an unexpected negative relationship with green political stances. More importantly, this research finds strong evidence that the adoption of RET is far more attractive for more rural habitats than urban ones, dampening the predictions for a sunny future in the Dutch PV market considerably.
