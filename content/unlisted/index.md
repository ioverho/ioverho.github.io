This page contains various other writing assignments or papers that I've (mostly) decided not to advertise on the main page.

## B.Sc. Writing

My Bachelor's program put a lot of emphasis on developing writing skills. As a result, even the more technical, scientific courses included a few long-form writing assignments. Despite their age, and my level of 'expertise', I remain quite proud of some of these. Feel free to peruse, just ignore the dates.

1. [The Beta Distribution](theory-of-statistics-and-data-analysis.pdf). May 2019, Mathematics
2. [Computational Text Analysis using R](computational-text-analysis-using-r.pdf). June 2019, Computer Science
3. [Adoption of Solar Panels by Dutch Households](adoption-of-solar-panels-by-dutch-households.pdf). December 2019, Econometrics
4. [General Collisions of Smooth Spheres](general-collisions-of-smooth-spheres.pdf). May 2020, Physics
5. [Probabilistic Graphical Models for Sequential Data](bsc-thesis.pdf). May 2020, Thesis

## M.Sc. Writing

My Master's program, on the other hand, put far more emphasis on standardized assignments and exercises. Having been a TA, I can understand why. Unfortunately, this hasn't led to a lot of writing that is truly unique. Nonetheless, I've placed some here.

1. [Inductive Biases for Morphologically Informed Neural Machine Translation](msc-thesis.pdf). August 2022, Thesis
