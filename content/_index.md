## About Me

I am a PhD canidate at the University of Amsterdam's [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), supervised by [Katia Shutova](https://www.shutova.org/) and [Pushkar Mishra](https://pushkarmishra.com/). I work at the intersection of misinformation detection and generalisation in NLP, and hope to build models that are robust to future forms of misinformation.

Before that (2020 - 2022) I was a MSc Artificial Intelligence student, also at the university of Amsterdam. I wrote my thesis on using meta-learning for translation in morphologically diverse languages, under supervision of [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io/). I did my undergrad at [University College Roosevelt](https://www.ucr.nl/) (2017 - 2020).
