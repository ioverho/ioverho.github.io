# About Me

I'm a PhD canidate at the University of Amsterdam's [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), supervised by [Katia Shutova](https://www.shutova.org/) and Pushkar Mishra. I work on misinformation detection and generalisation in NLP. My research interests further include machine translation, meta-learning and a variety of other topics.

Before that (2020 - 2022) I was a MSc Artificial Intelligence student, also at the university of Amsterdam. I wrote my thesis on translation in morphologically diverse languages, under supervision of [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io/). Before that (2017 - 2020) I studied at [University College Roosevelt](https://www.ucr.nl/).
