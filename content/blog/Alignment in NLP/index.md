For the 2025 edition of [Natural Language Processing 1](https://cl-illc.github.io/nlp1-2025/), I gave a lecture on alignment of LLMs to human preference. Once again, I used [slidev](https://sli.dev/) with the [Neversink](https://gureckis.github.io/slidev-theme-neversink/) theme to host these as a single page web app.

I've embedded the slides below, but they can also be seen in [full screen](https://www.ivoverhoeven.nl/nlp1-alignment).
